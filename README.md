# Transit-Costs
This exploration revolves around the Transit Cost Dataset provided by the Transit Cost project and posted on the Tidy Tuesday project. 
Given the growing concerns with climate change, public transportiation has been presented as a means to reduce city-wide carbon emissions. Given increased 
interest in U.S infastructure due to the recent American Jobs plan, it is important to analyze the most cost effective ways to build transit lines.
The goal of the exploration is to find what barriers related to cost are present in constructing these projects within the 50+ countries present within 
the dataset, mainly through the cost per km variable. This would provide insight into which countries have found the most success in minimizing construction costs and 
draw conclusions to how they compare to the United States. 

Questions this analysis will seek to answer include:

•	Which countries hold the lowest/highest cost per km in transit construction?
•	Do higher stations lead to higher cost per km ?
•	Do higher tunnel percentages lead to higher cost per km ?
•	Do certain continents have higher cost per km?
•	How does the U.S cost per km relate to other countries present within the dataset.
